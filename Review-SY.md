#Practical: Formative Groupwork Peer Review

##interest of content

*Acceptable

0 out of 4 content pages is interesting to me. Some are just copy and paste from wiki without any editting; some are to hard to follow.

##Consistency and quality of visual presentation

*Weak

1. For the home page, four seperate entrance to the content pages are not feeling well.

2. For the first three content page, with no background color; the visual effect is acceptable, and nothing is abnormal.

3. The last page about Computer Hardware is not good. First of all, the visual presentation is very different from other pages. Secondly, the font is kind of hard for recogonizing. Lastly, contents are too seperate and connot redirect to the home page easily.

##Quality of written presentation

*Good

1. For those paragraphs copied from internet, some edditing is necessary.

2. Rather than this, written presentation is not consedered.

##Validity of HTML

*Very Good

1. Home page, the <div> provided but necessary.

2. Internet, suggesting using more <div>. Empty paragraph <p></p> is used to create a space line, which is not acceptable to me.

3. *Excellent for AI (page)

4. *Very Good for Social Media (page), might want to consider presenting on a divice rather than PC.

5. *Excellent for Computer Hardware (page)

##Evidence of collaboration including

*Good

1. One of them seems finish the frame of the whole website individually. In which case is the header of it.

2. Author information is good.

3. works of contents are seperate well.

4. complete at the last minute XD
